1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 We haven't watched any of the M-GASIS films yet, but his film, although they do start to tell a story, we're going to watch, um, that's not very much showing you this.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 It knows you're me. It knows your meaning. It's not trying to pretend it's more, it's more the the theater film. And're very much, hey, look at this, look at this whole thing I can do.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And you can see that.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 So one of the distinction that got done in the essay that I gave you for today is the idea of

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 official voyeurism will become a very important term

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,600
 once we start talking about narrative cinema. But these are really opposite in terms of

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 the way that the film addressed audiences and the way that audiences watch these films.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,000
 So the idea of exhibitionism is that focus is on presenting things, presenting views,

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 showing you this motion, directly addressing you.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Remember we saw that dancers, the circus time dancers who were dancing.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 They're clearly looking at the camera, right?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 And the guy who is showing off his muscles, right?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 He's clearly, he's like, look at me, look at my muscle, right?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,960
 He's standing in front of the camera, showing his body.

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,240
 Once we move into narrative cinema, it becomes much more voyeurist.

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,160
 And so the idea of the way that it works is that it presents a sealed world.

17
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:45,000
 And it tries to portray story and character, but it generally speaking does not address you.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 What's an art form that preceded cinema that would be similarly voyeuristic and

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 a sealed world?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Novel? Yeah, that's a good one. Definitely. I mean there are certainly novels that do directly address the reader, but generally speaking if it's written in the first or third person.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Then it does have a kind of skewing role and you get to keep in the case.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Yeah, good.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So, it depends on the play, like live the theater is.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Yeah, absolutely, right?

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Theater in general was, you know, I mean, again, there could be moments where they

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:32,400
 break. What is the fourth wall is what is the fourth wall in theater that separates the viewer that separates the viewer of the story okay

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,960
 and how does that function in theater there's a three walls that left right and

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:47,000
 back then there's an invisible fourth wall Like you said, like separate the view on that.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Good, exactly.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And so, you would be like interacting with the audience or the view?

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Yeah, occasionally.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I mean, there are certainly plays where, you know, somebody will step forward and speak

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 to the audience, and that's called Breaking the Fourth Wall, right?

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 But generally, most plays, I mean, yes, it depends on the genre, I suppose it's a play.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 You know, you do not feel like you are in the space of the place.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 You feel like you are outside, looking in,

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 and there's this invisible fourth wall there that separates you from the action.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 So this voyeuristic approach to cinema really draws on that tradition.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,320
 This idea that there's a fourth wall and there's not going to be a direct direct that includes

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,120
 you in the space of cinema.

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,640
 But this had not been established yet, okay?

42
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,360
 This was not part of the cinema of attraction.

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 This came later.

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:47,000
 Okay, and so there's been a lot of interesting work around cinema around voyeurism and exhibitions.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Okay, so this comes from psychoanalysis, the idea of voyeurism as a voyeur being somebody

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 who gave pleasure from watching others while remaining unseen themselves.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So cinema certainly has voyeuristic pleasure involved, right?

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,040
 We like the fact that we can watch a movie,

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,560
 and nobody can see us.

50
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
 We don't feel seen, but we get to look.

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
 We get to see everything, but there is no look returned to us.

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,200
 There are films that purposely break that,

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,000
 kind of like their theater plays that do that.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,760
 But sometimes it's very shocking.

55
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,800
 Can you think of a moment of direct address to surprise you,

56
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
 was disruptive in some way?

57
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
 Yeah, back there.

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,160
 Is it the Truman Show?

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,720
 Okay, good. Yeah, can you, can you, give an example?

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,000
 Um, you know, to take  was presented in the audience and the great

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 time that you can see?

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Yeah, right, how many people have seen it?

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Yeah, so, you know, this is a story of somebody who doesn't realize that they're

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 being filmed all the time, and so, you know, he's living in this field universe

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 but eventually realizes that and eventually addresses a camera directly, breaking that fourth wall of the

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 viewers who have been watching them.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Good.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Okay.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Exhibitionism is the opposite.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 It's somebody who wants to be exhibitionistic.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So these are kind of competing tendency, right?

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 theate.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,360
 And this is also an aspect of a psychoanalysisisist that certain people have this tendency to want to be exhibitionistic.

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,600
 So these are kind of competing tendency within early cinema, which is on the one hand that

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,000
 people had a desire to look at things and they do not be seen themselves.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,120
 And those early kinetoscope films, those people devices, those already hinted towards

77
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,240
 a certain voyeurism, right? Looking through a little peepole, that's, so, so, so th, th, so th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, the, the, th, thi, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, the, thi, they, they, they, they, thi, thi, thi, the, the, the, the, theeeeeeeeeeeeee, thi, the, the, thi,  right? Looking through a little peephole, that's there's something inherently voyeuristic about that, right?

78
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
 So that was already there.

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,960
 But this early cinema tended to be much more exhibition.

80
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:12,000
 All right, so I do want to show you an early film from France, very early, 1896. And so, the ride retires is, in some ways, it is hinting at a sealed world in which there

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 are characters having an interaction with one another.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But, on the other hand, there's a way in which it clearly addressed it in

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 times. This does not look like Cinema would look in a few years.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 So I want to look at this.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I just try to do this differently.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:49,280
 Today it won't be so difficult to switch back. All right, and you know, there's some things.

87
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
 A lot of voyeurism is about watching women undress.

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,040
 There's a lot of women undressing in early cinema.

89
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,720
 And you know, there's something.

90
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,000
 A lot of voyeurism is about watching women undress.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 There's a lot of women undressing in early cinema.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 We already saw it in, you know, Moibrege.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And so there's a part of what we see in this as well.

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 But let's just pay attention to how the actors are behaving in relation to the camera. I. Thank you. I'll try. So, on the one hand, we have a little story here.

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 What's the story we could tell about the little film?

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 It's a wedding night and they're going to bed and she's having any...

97
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 be on the other side of the partition to give her some privacy while she's in dressing

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 and he obviously wants to see her for the first time.

99
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Right, so he starts speaking, right?

100
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 So we have a narrative with a little bit of voyeurism in it, right, of him wanting to see her. But it is not presented in any way from his point of view, right?

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 You don't get a point of view shot. That did not exist yet.

102
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So how is this, how is it, but how does this so address the camera?

103
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 How are we from the audience by looking at them, interacting with them, at all of the

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 puppies off in the corner, like reading the newspaper, being excited at the wife's getting

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 addressed.

106
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 What is that?

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Yeah, and she's not just like addressing us, she's very much pointed at us, right?

108
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 We are being shown her taking off her clothes, right?

109
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It could have been films, you know, theoretically, a different way, and it would have a very different effect.

110
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:52,640
 It's very exhibitionistic. It is showing us this woman taking off her clothes, even though it is within the context of this nice story of, you know, married couple. Okay, so does that make sense in terms of exhibitionism

111
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,400
 and attraction and the way that it's addressing us? Very different from what would come later.

112
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,800
 Later, there would be this sort of healed universe. You would still have, you know,

113
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,000
 you like a husband, you know, wanting to peek over in his wife, but the camera and the editing would want differently.

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Also, how many shots with this?

115
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 One, right? Still just one shot, this is 1896.

116
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Everything was essentially still in one shot.

117
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Okay, then, the stripte, the director, and she's the exhibition. Okay, then later on, we start to move towards a voyeuristic cinema.

118
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 So I just want to show you...

119
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I'll put this on a playbook for you.

120
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,280
 But later on, we get similar kinds of performances but the actors

121
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:55,600
 are not clearly performing. This is Rita Hayworth and Gilda and we look on as

122
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,240
 she is getting undressed but she's clearly not performing for us rather we get

123
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,000
 a point of time.

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So, in the great train robbery, when I do them was free, which we'll take a look at now,

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 so that you can see it, there is a really important close-up, because close-ups,

126
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 people are not sure how a close-up was not a thing yet.

127
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,880
 This is not something people had figured out yet or knew what to do it.

128
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,280
 And so this is when we start to see some continuity editing,

129
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,360
 but we also get direct address to the class.

130
00:12:33,360 --> 00:13:06,000
 So let's take a look at the Great Train Robbery so that you can see how the library. I think we will watch the whole thing right now. I think it's that. So let's take a look at this. It's 13 minutes long.

131
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So you start to see narrative, but pay attention to the editing and to the moments,

132
00:13:12,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 moment or moments, where it starts to feel more exhibitionistic than we might anticipate. Congress in Washington DC. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I I'm sorry. Oh. I I I. Oh. I'm sorry. Okay. I'll be Oh, the today. Okay. Oh. I. Oh, the tp. Oh. Oh Oh. I. I'm sorry. Yes. Oh. Oh, no. I I I. I'm going to. I This has been a presentation of the Library of Congress. We have an estimate. You're thin. Yeah, more of that.

133
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 What do you think?

134
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Anybody, stand it up?

135
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Six.

136
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 No.

137
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 You guys not even close.

138
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Is that?

139
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Especially 14 shots.

140
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Yeah.

141
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Which is a lot for the period.

142
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So there is editing here. And, you know, it's still very slow-paced compared to what we're using now, which is really fast.

143
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 But it's 14 shots. Tell me how, how are these, well first of all, what are these shots look like?

144
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 How are they framed? How are we, how are we given the information, what are we looking at?

145
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Yeah.

146
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 I thought you were a gunshot, the perfect one.

147
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Oh, sorry, they're kind of an exhibition is, or

148
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 you know, voyeuristic in a way, in the way that it's set up a scene to be very much like a stage,

149
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 but then they gradually get a little bit more of the firing of gunshot

150
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 at the very end breaks that, right?

151
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I mean, we do have something of a voyeuristic cinema emerging here, right?

152
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Nobody looks directly at the camera until the very end.

153
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,520
 There are still elements of exhibitionism or there are moments where you thought like you felt

154
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,000
 more addressed by the camera.

155
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:56,600
 Every desk that was very theatrical, it was like played directly to the camera and also the

156
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,000
 random dancing where the man comes in and like dances right in the center and

157
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 the visual. Yeah, absolutely, right?

158
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 The fact that everything is sort of centered, or most, many, as much of the action is centered,

159
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 gives us that sense of like playing to the camera, but particularly the dance scene, right?

160
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 It's not, there's no real need for that, for the narrative, and it's clearly performed for the camera,

161
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 right?

162
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Showing us this dance scene.

163
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Good. Did anyone notice any camera movement?

164
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 We got to shout from here in the back.

165
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 It has to use of canny and tilting and I find like this is the first film.

166
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,160
 Like this is right to be, yeah, I mean we're not a hundred percent sure because a lot of early cinema was lost, but this is

167
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,040
 one of the first time that there started to be some movement of the camera following

168
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
 the characters.

169
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,960
 So anyone notice which shot, do we see that in?

170
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,360
 Yes, I know it's whenever they're going downhill out of the train, they're

171
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:07,000
 out of the train. Yeah, exactly. When they get out of the train and get on the horses, right, and we see some

172
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,080
 camera in this thing, right? This again, is new, as an experiment, just trying to figure

173
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,240
 out how this would work.

174
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,240
 That's the similarity in other species, and this one, and it's a good idea.

175
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,000
 I feel like there. Yeah, absolutely. And that is something that you will be a simple time to sound.

176
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I mean, because the marketing to the news or the actors that are not sure if they're

177
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 moving it or direct to silent to, so it is that great to the night,

178
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 it mentions of, beyond this, the same, or the other.

179
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Yeah, absolutely.

180
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And that is something that you will notice that is characteristic of silent cinema,

181
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 is that they wanted people to know what's going on and what people were feeling.

182
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 And with that word, that can be hard to do, right?

183
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 So you get a lot of, you know, that kind of thing.

184
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Just very, overly, overly, for us, overly dramatic facial expressions and movies.

185
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 What is the funniest part of this film?

186
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 There's kind of a guy that he's like punching and then you just see the dummy who grows off

187
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,600
 to the train, clearly too light to be a person. Yeah, realism, I mean, you know, they're sort of trying to create realism, but with limitations, right?

188
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
 That was the point was to tell this thrilling story.

189
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
 For us, of course, you know, these takes seem, these shots seemed quite long.

190
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,000
 Again, we could have had much short, we could have gotten the same information with more ellip-seas,

191
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:51,760
 but again, that was not necessarily part of it. Everyone, everyone hit their their their their th. their th – their  see everyone. Everyone hit their money and jewel taken. So we know that we are very bad. But of course at the end that shot is really

192
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,800
 unmotivated. Narratively unmotivated. It doesn't make any sense. Why not? Yeah.

193
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:07,680
 It doesn't move the story forward in any way. Yeah. I mean the story basically ended at that point. Yeah

194
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,480
 the thieves seem to all have died right and then suddenly he appears and he's

195
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,800
 much everyone noticed that where with the camera in terms of camera distance in

196
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:27,000
 relation to imagine that, I mean, these are

197
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 movie screens, this is projected, this guy looks big to people, right? We're used to big,

198
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 but people that were not used to seeing human beings projected at, you know, twice or three times,

199
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 or five times their size. So, and also then he's pointing a gun directly at the camera.

200
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 This is a very dramatic moment in cinema for audiences.

201
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 I mean, you know, having a gun pointed at you even if you know that you can't be shot does

202
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 feel dramatic, right?

203
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 It's a very specific and aggressive address to the camera.

204
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,520
 So again, that's sort of going back to the cinema of attraction. People were very thrilled by this shot.

205
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,960
 They had never existed in something like that.

206
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,160
 Wasn't there a day like in terms of the people reacted

207
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,000
 running out of the theater to the train?

208
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,920
 They were the gunshot for this.

209
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:27,760
 I could not have heard that, but probably. I mean, the thing is there's all kinds of these stories about early cinema, and nobody knows whether they're really true.

210
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,800
 I mean, the journalists at the time

211
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,640
 would say all kinds of things to make it all sound very exciting.

212
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,480
 I don't know.

213
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:45,000
 But yeah. So you can see that there's this movement towards narrative, but part of the thrill would still still th th the thrill was still be addressed to the audience, right?

214
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Specifically, I think it was your best job.

215
00:33:47,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Okay, I understand. Did anyone have trouble following the narrative? Is that even confusing? Were you lost at any point?

216
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 You know, it's pretty clear, right?

217
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 They were already, you know, establishing continuity of time and space.

218
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 It's not as seamless as we will see later on, but, you know,

219
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 first we know that we're inside the train depot.

220
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Then we know that we're, you know, outside, next to the train. Then we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we that we lost that we lost that we're lost that we're lost that we're lost that we're lost the the, that we're lost that we're lost the. that we lost the. the. that we're lost the. the. the. the. the. the. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th.  the train depot. Then we know that we're, you know, outside, next to the train.

221
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Then we know that we're in the train, right?

222
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 It's pretty clear where we're going from one place to another.

223
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 So, there was some other close-ups that were used during the series,

224
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 but it was not the kind of closups that were used during this period, but it were not the

225
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 kind of closets that we usually think of.

226
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 What's the main function of close-up in contemporary systems?

227
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 You're going to see the character's thoughts or feelings in a way?

228
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Yeah, because the classic is a close-up of somebody's face, right? If you want to see what they're feeling, but even they're not there, it's going to say the their their their their to get to get their to get to get to get to get to get to get to get their to get to get a to get a the sort of classic is a close-up of somebody's face, right? If you want to see what they're feeling, but you're not there.

229
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Say it out loud, you're going to get a close-up of someone's face.

230
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 If you...

231
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 It also allows the director of the creative to direct attention to the audience to the

232
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:26,920
 audience to be concerned, especially. And that is what you start to see in a early thing, okay?

233
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,440
 It's just sort of pointing out something that the director, producer,

234
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,440
 I don't really clear director to this point, want to do this.

235
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,560
 So let's take a really quick look at, um,

236
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:46,000
 these early music close up.

237
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And the day of shoot. I'm sorry. I'm going to have a little. Okay, so everyone noticed the use of the close-up there while, and then in order to

238
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 really further the narrative, we have to have the close-up of the shoe and then for a person.

239
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 And then we go back to a long shot.

240
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,200
 So, again, not psychological realism, no close up on a face or anything like that, but,

241
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,640
 you know, starting to cut into the space to show us something in particular and then back

242
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
 out again.

243
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
 And this was legible to people, right?

244
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,000
 So, understood, okay, we're moving from a wide shot into a close-up and back to a wide shot,

245
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 no confusion. So the sort of attractions really doesn't disappear.

246
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 It survives as respectable.

247
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 It becomes a component of narrative films.

248
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Action movies, there are frequently sequences that don't really further the narrative films.

249
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 Action movies, there are frequently sequences  That don't really further the narrative, right?

250
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Can you think of an action film or any film you've seen recently

251
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 where there was a spectacle that really wasn't about advancing the narrative,

252
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 but rather about the spectacle itself?

253
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Yeah.

254
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,200
 The Rockway by Michael Day, the rock by Michael Bay with the cage. There's just this completely ridiculous car chase

255
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,440
 sequins and then a random truck that's not even in the chase

256
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,240
 sequence just like towards and keeps flipping down the phone

257
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,000
 where the gas station was going to create this big

258
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,320
 Yeah, absolutely, right? We don't go to action movies for the clock, really. I mean, sure, we want a plot.

259
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,600
 There has to be a story for us to get involved in it.

260
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,680
 The reason to go see a Michael Bay movie

261
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,800
 is to watch things blow up and flip over and do all kinds of friends.

262
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,120
 That is still an attraction in itself.

263
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:48,000
 It's folded into a narrative, but that just desire to see something cool, it's still very much part of things.

264
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 So there's these kind of pre-sentational moments.

265
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 And, you know, musicals, for instance.

266
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 A lot of people think, oh, I don't like musicals because suddenly, it's so unrealistic,

267
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 people start singing and dancing.

268
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,600
 Okay, yes, it is unrealistic, but the point is that they're singing and dancing for you, right? It is about showing you, showing you this musical

269
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,240
 number, showing you a performance that interrupts the narrative flow, but it has its own

270
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,080
 thousands.

271
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:28,920
 Okay, so later on in the term, you're going to talk more about Einstein when we talk about Soviet

272
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,440
 cinema, but this word attraction actually comes from his theoretical writing.

273
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,640
 He was a co-maker but also a film theorist.

274
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,040
 And so his idea of the attraction was the idea of a unit of impression, right?

275
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,000
 But there's something that impresses us that makes us go, huh? Wow. And so the idea being, the idea of the idea is the idea is the idea is the idea is the idea the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea the idea  impression, that there's something that impresses us, that makes us go,

276
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,360
 huh? Wow. And so the idea being that the spectator would have kind of a sensual or psychological

277
00:40:53,360 --> 00:41:00,200
 impact. It isn't, again, necessarily about story, but it's about reaction in some way. And this

278
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,320
 was something that people thought, right? People were thrilled to get. And we're still thrilled to get.

279
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,280
 So, you know, things like roller coasters

280
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,760
 are becoming popular at this time.

281
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,040
 You know, and these were referred to also as attraction

282
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,880
 within the fairground, fairground.

283
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:26,240
 So, you know, sort of linking the fairground experience, of a kind of a physical thrill to some of what thuuuion, thiii, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-sovi-sovi-in, thi-s, thi-s, thi-s, and tho, and thi-so, and thi-so, thi-so, thi-so, thi-so, thi-so, thi-so, thi-so, thi-so, thi-a-a-a-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-in, thi-s thi-s thi-s was something something something something thi-s was something thi-s was something thi-s was something thioliolioliolioli-s was something thioliolioli-s were thioli-s thi-s thi-s thi experience of a physical thrill to some part of what

284
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:33,040
 Eisenstein talked about and then about gunning was reframed early since.

285
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:41,600
 And one thing that this also brings up was the class distinction that was going on

286
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,440
 this is. Generally attractions appealed to or

287
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,520
 marketed to a sort of more working class audience like that early cinema I mean

288
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,480
 you know the rich people might show up just to see what was going on

289
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:04,480
 but generally was a very you know nickel we watch a film in the Nickelodeon

290
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,000
 this is not an expensive thing.

291
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 These are Nickelodeons were often in the downtown areas, the not necessarily the fancy

292
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 part, right?

293
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 They were framed within kind of a working, as a working class in the middle class.

294
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 The middle class, upper classes, tended to revere sort of more contemplative arts, and

295
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 spent the times did not figure into that at all.

296
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 So it's very much a kind of like drill-speaking kind of entertainment.

297
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 And this is a very much part of just the wider experience of the experience of the experience.

298
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 It's the sort of experience of astonishment.

299
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 You have to kind of think about how this was in a moment where all these people who live

300
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:06,600
 in rural areas, there's on farms, no films there, there was to some degree very little industrialization at all, very quiet, people

301
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,920
 moving to the city where you suddenly had automobiles, and there was still horse-drawn

302
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,000
 carriers as well, you had trained, you had lots of people, you had people from all over

303
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 the world, you did not have good traffic patterns, people were constantly getting run over.

304
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,040
 You know, this was a very chaotic space, and so it was sort of people were constantly feeling the sense of astonishment.

305
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:34,440
 And cinema played into that.

306
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,160
 One thing that Sotting also talks about, and I think that was very interesting.

307
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,360
 He says, only a careful consideration of the historical context of these earliest images

308
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:50,880
 and restore an understanding of the uncanny and agitating power they exerted on audiences. This contact includes the first

309
00:43:50,880 --> 00:44:11,000
 notes of exhibition, the tradition of the century visual entertainment, and a series of visual shock. The idea is that each of these films are supposed to shock the effect and brilliant, rather

310
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 than immersed in its proper historical context, the projection of a first using images stands

311
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 at a climac of a period of intense development in visual entertainment,

312
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,800
 a tradition in with realism with value largely for its unclamed effect.

313
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,520
 Okay, so realism here is not the psychological realism

314
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,640
 that we tend to associate with dramatic cinema.

315
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,880
 Okay, this was much more about the sense of copying something

316
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,840
 to reality and coming into a picture.

317
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,000
 And this was kind of the wider relationship of the urban impacts.

318
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 So this played into all of the larger experiences that people would have in the world.

319
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 And another aspect of this, let's go back to our earlier discussion of Tick-Tock. It was part of, you know, a slew of entertainment.

320
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 You wouldn't go to watch a movie.

321
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 You would go to a Bobville show in which a movie would be one part.

322
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 You would also have fireaders, acrobat, you know,

323
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 people singing thumbs, playing instruments, all of those sorts of things.

324
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 And so it was all integrated into this larger experience of intense experience, intense short experiences

325
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 that were multi-needed.

326
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 There's a really great book for Wolfing, Chibulbush, that he's talking about, which talks about

327
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 the transformation, the experience of time in the state.

328
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Very interested period to ask them to read

329
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 Shibble Bush's book, we talk about the railways.

330
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 The railways was a really important way to experience.

331
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 So, once again, Wolfgang's understanding of the changes in modern perception

332
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,440
 brought about by railway travel provides a theoretical tool.

333
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,360
 Cross-breeding Freud's metaphysical formulations with urban sociology is civil.

334
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,840
 And thus, following the direct your opinion, I thought right now,

335
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,400
 Sildes describes a stimulus shield which inhabitants of the over-stimulated environments

336
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:27,000
 of the modern world developed in order to ward off its possible. But one to also point out that the stimulus shield dulls the edge of experience,

337
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 and more intense aesthetic energies are required to penetrate it.

338
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 As Mirian Hansen points out in her reading,

339
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 the modern experience of shock corresponds to the adaptation of human perception

340
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 of industrial modes of production and transportation,

341
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 especially the radical restructuration of spatial and temporal relations.

342
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Shock becomes not only a mode of modern experience, but a strategy of modern aesthetic

343
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 and astonishment, hence the explication of new technological thrill dispurpose.

344
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 What does that mean?

345
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 What does it mean? They use film at this point as a mean to escape from real life, but over exposure to that

346
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 she will fill in their own senses.

347
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 But over exposure to that she fills your own senses?

348
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 That you just have to go out and live, real life with.

349
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Good. Yeah, in a sense, you know, we have modern life, and even now, right?

350
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 Think about all the ways we try to shield ourselves from the world.

351
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 How many people walk around with your birthday?

352
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,920
 I mean, that would be an example

353
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,320
 of it, right? You're shielding yourself from your environment to some extent. Do you

354
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,440
 think of other examples with ways in which we shield ourselves from the environment?

355
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:01,120
 Yeah, good. When you sort of don't want to be wherever you are, you just look at your

356
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,000
 phone and you can kind of disappear into it. So how does cinema play into that?

357
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 You want to unpack it a little further?

358
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 Depending on what type of movie you watch, I'm watching Harry Potter, I'm like, I don't want to be in a world right now, I just want to...

359
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 This is a much more idea place to be the the film.

360
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 Okay, so there's an es't want to be able to go right now. This is a much more idea place to be there.

361
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Okay, so there's an escapism to it, right, that you're getting out of the sort of shocks of modern life.

362
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 And yet, if you watch a Harry Potter movie, it's got a lot of shocks in it as well, right?

363
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:48,320
 I mean, part of the reason the special effects are compelling is because they provide the kind the kind kind kind the kind there's this weird way in which on the one hand we want to protect ourselves from

364
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,840
 shocks, but at the same time we want them too.

365
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,560
 And then we need ever stronger shocks in order to penetrate what we've gotten used to in some

366
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,560
 sense.

367
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:07,000
 So there's an interesting cycle of, you know, on the one hand, trying to protect ourselves from the shocks of maturity

368
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 and also being drawn towards them and then needing kind of more and more.

369
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 There's a certainness, perhaps addi-dictiveness to it.

370
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 I think they're limited to well, it's like controlled and by the shock.

371
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,240
 Yeah, so in some ways we can kind of injure ourselves, like we kind of train ourselves on cinema

372
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,640
 so that we're better prepared to deal with them in real life in a way.

373
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,840
 Yes, because we don't actually have to suffer the consequence of the situation.

374
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,960
 If you're referring to like the optical unconscious when you're talking about

375
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:47,000
 meaning, that's something that's a little bit, I can't testry to assume what he's talking about maybe.

376
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 Not specifically the optical unconscious, the Venomene's kind of the theories of modernity.

377
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 I mean, so Benamine, Walter Benjam was one of the sort of most important theorist of modernity.

378
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 You should all read Benimin at some point. He's a beautiful writer.

379
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 But what he would do is he would wander around Paris and other urban spaces.

380
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,640
 And just sort of observe modern life and try to understand what was going on because it was

381
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,360
 so weird at the time, right?

382
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,800
 And he was one of these people who could kind of see, what is this, right, and you'd

383
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,800
 write about it.

384
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:27,000
 And so this idea of kind of an urban sociology, he would record what he thought. But one of the things he talked about is how the kinds of games that were played,

385
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 for instance from a fairground, we're also kind of training grounds for factories, right?

386
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 People were basically being trained by their entertainments to also participate in capitalism.

387
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 So that's kind of more what you're going to work here.

388
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 Questions about this?

389
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 The thing I want to emphasize is just the absolute transformative experience of this moment.

390
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 People experience a time, of space through cinema, from railway travel,

391
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 through, you know, just the urban itself, was so different from what came before it,

392
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 that it's almost impossible, I think.

393
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 We at this point, we're so used to it, we can barely imagine, right?

394
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 But this was such a shift from what had come before,

395
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 for pretty much everybody.

396
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 And to, I'm so much a participant in this larger restructure.

397
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 Okay. Let's see. We have a little bit of time, so I want to actually move on to some other stuff.

398
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 Actually, any questions about that before I'm going to.

399
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 Okay, I'm going to start this lecture, which I will continue next.

400
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 I'm going to start this lecture, which I will continue to do.

401
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 So one of the first things that emerged as soon as you turn a camera on was Mies Olfen.

402
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 So then here to speak French.

403
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 What is Muzon mean?

404
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 I put this place so it placed in the scene.

405
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 And this term already existed from Theater, right?

406
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 Theater also had Misan.

407
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 And basically it just means what you put in the frame and where you put it.

408
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 It's everything that you see within the frame.

409
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 So... you put it. It's everything that you see within the frame. So, what could you say about the

410
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:42,680
 mizonsense here? That is perhaps different from how we might imagine, mizoncene later on?

411
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,000
 There is a massive pain in the back. Okay, so we have a back drum, right? Right. So the later on, what you're going to make. Yeah.

412
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 There's a massive painting in the back.

413
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 Okay, so we have a backdrop, right?

414
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 The setting is painted, there's a lot of painted backdrops early on,

415
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 which is not to be realistic, and yet it serves an important function, right?

416
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 It's setting in the seat.

417
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 Good. What else can you say about the mean whole thing? It's on the stage and a lot of discrepanies so you can have a lot of action for the

418
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 stuff.

419
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 I'm sorry, with the last year's said?

420
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 It's a lot of people in the frame, so you can have a lot of people in the frame.

421
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 So you can have a lot of people.

422
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 the things that lot of things could happen in this space because we have all these people.

423
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 One of the things that's interesting about this image, but also perhaps about some of the

424
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 shots in the great train robbery.

425
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 It's a little hard to know where to look sometimes.

426
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 Did anyone notice that?

427
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 There's a lot there, and our attention is not directing in any particular way. We have all of these people on the stage.

428
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 Yeah, good.

429
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 We have multiple planes of action, right?

430
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 They have a foreground, a background, and then we have this thing that's, you know,

431
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 sticking into the space, right?

432
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 The telescope. into the space, right? A little bit of the telescope. Okay, so we'll get some more charts, but you can start to see that this is framed in a particular way.

433
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 Everything is positioned in a specific way to convey setting and a certain amount of information.

434
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 So there are four major components that we all have.

435
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 The first one are setting and prox.

436
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 Whatever the backdrop is and then the things in the scene,

437
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 what would you say is the setting of this image?

438
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 What would you say is the settingell this one? Yeah, it looks like some kind of living room or study, right?

439
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 We have a nice chair, nice carpet, right?

440
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:29,600
 What can we tell about this character, about what can we tell about what we might be going on just from the house or he's like invading someone else's face and he's

441
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,600
 waiting for them.

442
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,320
 Okay, good. Yeah, I mean, we don't know specifically, you know, whether this is his

443
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,560
 face or not, but he's certainly looks very comfortable in it, right?

444
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:45,000
 So, there's a, I mean, that has to do perhaps more with human figure, right, the way he's sitting. But yeah.

445
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 He's dressed very sharply, so you can kind of infer that he's up, middle to upper class,

446
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 and the fact that he's also in that nice chair with nice carpets, and if he has enough space to have a study like this, we can ensure that he has money.

447
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 Yeah, good.

448
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 I mean, this is a wealthy setting, right?

449
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 We can tell just from looking at this that he is probably a wealthy man and that this is a wealthy space,

450
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 whether it's his or not, right?

451
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 Yeah. The lighting can infer both it's supposed to be an area of comfort but also at the same time,

452
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 if you know the context of the scene or how he's purged, you know it's also supposed

453
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 to represent something sinister.

454
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 Okay, good. Yeah, I mean this kind of lighting suggests, it's suggestive of something

455
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
 either mysterious or dangerous, right?

456
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 This particular, you know, some sidelines suggest that, in combination of the figures think

457
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 to try to that.

458
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 Yeah, I was going to ask that his actual position and where he is in the frame, he's directly

459
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 in the middle, it's like he's directing the most attention towards him.

460
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
 And the lie to also play the important work because itowards him. And the Lydon also played a part of the work person.

461
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 A very serious person who's shown.

462
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 Yeah, absolutely.

463
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 The way he's positioned, right in the center of the frame, the way he's lit, the way he's

464
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 positioned on this chair, right?

465
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 Everything about him suggests a certain kind of power, wealth and power.

466
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 For one image, we can get that, right? Okay, enough. All right, we're going to get to each of these things.

467
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 We'll talk about them.

468
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 But for setting is just the place for the film's action on film.

469
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 Okay, many settings, but the setting includes both the sort of general locations and also the specific ones.

470
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,920
 Okay, I mean the films may be set in, I don't know, Italy, but there might also be specific

471
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,840
 spaces, certain house, within the narrative.

472
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,120
 So, you have both general specific locations.

473
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,400
 They can also be imaginary, but still a setting.

474
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,880
 What does it need to be shot on location versus on a set?

475
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:05,000
 Location is the raw natural environment where it's

476
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
 is constructed.

477
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 Okay, good.

478
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 Yeah, so.

479
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 And what would be a benefit of shooting on location?

480
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 You don't have to worry about lighting as much since you have a lot of times you're on

481
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 location and your outdoors.

482
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 So, it'll look like the real place, whereas trying to imitate the sun in a set is very difficult

483
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 for you.

484
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 So you use a natural light, yeah, and of course when you're dealing with shooting on location,

485
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 you do have to worry about things like time of day and weather and things like

486
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 that, which you don't have to worry about on set, but you do get that realism.

487
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 Yeah.

488
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
 Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
 You know about those two things?

490
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 What would be the benefits of shooting on set?

491
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 The set is just like so much more control overall, but it also is like insanely expensive.

492
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 So like, especially if you're doing a student film or a low budget

493
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,600
 shooting on

494
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,000
 set up to their own possible.

495
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 But also there's a difference in that it just kind of produces two different styles.

496
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 So, you also have to choose it based on a story that you're telling.

497
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
 Yeah, I mean, there are times when you want to shoot on location, right?

498
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 They have different advantages.

499
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:31,000
 Shooting on set you have a lot more control, generally speaking, but they're the, a lot of

500
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 realism usually, right?

501
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 Even if it's very expensive to make it.

502
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 And now, of course, studying the fantasy film or sci-fi.

503
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,000
 So, that is one way of cutting costs, generally and not having to

504
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 shoot a fantasy film or sci-fi, a couple of functions of setting, establishing the time

505
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
 and space, right? A couple of functions of setting, establishing the time and space, right?

506
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,160
 Whether that is, you know, it's a sunset, or it is in the deep towel, some of the sorts of things, right? You know, there's going to be to be to be the the to be the the the, the, to be the the the, the to be the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the th, but the the the the the the, but the, but the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, but the, but the, but the, but the, but the, but the, but thi, but thi, but thi, but thi, but thi, but the, but the, but the, but the, the, the, the, threate, threate, threate, threate, tooooooooooooo, tipe, but citae, but the, but the, but threate, but the, but th right? Whether that is, you know, it's a sunset or it is in the deep

507
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:10,080
 towel, some of the sorts of things, right? You know, there's going to be a certain sense

508
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:16,880
 of time and space that it's automatically established by the setting. Ideas in theme can also be

509
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:35,000
 indicated by the setting and also move, all of those things come together in a specific wind. We can get a sense of the the the timetimetimetimetimetimetimetimetimetimetime the the the time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time the the the the the the the theogether in the desert you've gone with a wind. We can get a time space, a certain feeling that comes from the tour.

510
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 Certain settings are very much associated with the good ones that are the genre the

511
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
 searchers is?

512
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 It's in the deserts, you know. It's in the deserters is.

513
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
 Exactly. It's in the deserts basically, you know, and particularly if you have a horse coming by, it's not setting up figures. It's going to suggest a western, right? What about Blade Runner?

514
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 Let me tell what genre it is just from setting?

515
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
 It's like a cyberpoint type of world.

516
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 Yeah, good.

517
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 And we have a flying car, which suggests also sci-fi.

518
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 So very quickly, right?

519
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 Setting tells us what kind of movie we are watching.

520
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
 Not always, but free to watch them.

521
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 Okay, so we're going to watch this theme from the Gold Rush,

522
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,200
 Charlie Chaplin, pay attention to measles scent.

523
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,200
 The composition, the lighting, the props, human figures.

524
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,200
 What do we know just from looking at the measles scent?

525
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,200
 And yeah, there's action to them.

526
01:01:35,200 --> 01:05:50,000
 And that's part. I'm going to be a little. I'm going to be a little. I'm sorry. So, setting.

527
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 I don't know what we see in terms of setting.

528
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:07,000
 Yeah. holiday decoration at a Christmas tree. When they come to the door we see snow outside.

529
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
 Two beds and the guests are the small.

530
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 Good, exactly.

531
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
 Without any explicit, you know, title or anything saying it's Christmas, we get that sense,

532
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 right? We have the prop of the tree, and the starlens, yeah, absolutely.

533
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,800
 The way he's putting down the napkins, the gifts, getting the roast ready, he's clearly

534
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,360
 like getting ready for a party the way he answered the door, expecting like someone to walk

535
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,360
 through her own.

536
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,360
 Yeah, absolutely.

537
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,600
 You know, he's clearly, you know, setting the, setting the table for a celebration,

538
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:45,000
 which appears to be a Christmas celebration. Good. Yeah. One of the stories, like,

539
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,800
 both the contrast of the actions versus like the New

540
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,000
 Sam or it's like, obviously delusional, like,

541
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
 these acting like these, like, rich, you've got to get rid of a party

542
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
 or, it reflects a lot of importance on like,

543
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 uh, no, and all this and that, but, uh, yeah, it's just kind of sad.

544
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 Yeah, I mean, we can tell from the settings that he's probably not a wealthy man, right? He looks like he's living in a cabin.

545
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 It's a very narrow, small, kind of phosphorobic space.

546
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
 His old stove certainly doesn't look fancy.

547
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
 And then when the women appear in his fantasy, they clearly look out of their costumes, right?

548
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 Because of their costumes in contrast to the same.

549
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 Good.

550
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 Do we have to see a little bit of the cinema of attractions here, appearing at all?

551
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,000
 On the one hand, it's certainly a voyeuristic, you know, we're looking in on his fantasy,

552
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:49,720
 but yes. Oh, when he does the dance with the role which played the performance for us for the camera I mean that clearly is a performance for us

553
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,440
 I mean it's addressed to those women theoretically but it's really for us

554
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,320
 right he's doing a funny performance but they don't which I enjoyed very

555
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:05,000
 much. Anything else about the Mieson Sen?

556
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:20,000
 I really love in his fantasy the way that cameras positions, the women are all around him. You know, they're surrounding him, it's almost like this comfort, and then it contrasts really sadly with this

557
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
 this shot where there's this lack of that and just like darkness where they were.

558
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
 Yeah, yeah, exactly, right? The way that he's framed, right, by the women suggests, you know,

559
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
 oh, he's being celebrated and they're clapping for him, he gets a kiss, all the sorts of things.

560
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 And then, of course, they disappear and he's left alone and just really emphasizes the same.

561
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
 Good. Good. All right, I'm going to show you one more clip,

562
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:55,000
 all right, I'm going to just show you one more clip to contrast, even if you have some more to talk about it.

563
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:46,000
 Think about me built it. Good evening, Mr. Thomas. I'm back.

564
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 Good evening, Mr. Thomas.

565
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
 It's good to see you.

566
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
 It's good to be back, Lloyd.

567
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
 What does he say?

568
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
 Hair or the dog that bid me.

569
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
 Where the the rocks?

570
01:10:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
 That'll do. No charge. You know what is no good here. What about the tons? What do you say about the setting? What about the setting? What does it suggest?

571
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
 A different time period, right?

572
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 The way that everybody's dressed.

573
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
 Of course, very opulence.

574
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
 I'm very curious.

575
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
 And so,

576
01:11:15,000 --> 01:12:27,000
 we have a cold and lighting, I'm not going to be free to start walking right. Oh my. I'm so so sorry.

577
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
 Uh, let me.

578
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
 After you, Jay.

579
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
 Thank you.

580
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
 I'm sorry to get back to it.

581
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
 It was Friday.

582
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
 Who's the one of it?

583
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
 Monday, Wednesday, Wednesday.

584
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 Let me check  in my file. From most of the phone to the reporter.

585
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
 Who are in there?

586
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
 You know?

587
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
 Or do?

588
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
 Oh, you have a coffee?

589
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
 Yes?

590
01:12:56,000 --> 01:15:27,000
 All right. Thank you. Oh shit. I think. We have butterflies come up and feel like, oh, like, the throws an hour. I'm a little close of the time. Oh my god. He's got a photo right now. He's got a pizza pogo.

591
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
 I'm gonna eat the puky.

592
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
 I'm gonna

593
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
 How do you get it?

594
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
 Do you?

595
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
 Do you?

596
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:47,000
 I'm just We were not. They were not. They were not. Oh, we're fucking the world.

597
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:54,000
 They were definitely activated.

598
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
 Oh, and they're just...

599
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
 Oh, and they're...

600
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:25,000
 And they... Oh my goddoh yeah. We both took it to 1A, right? But, yes and he has some takes time.

601
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
 Now he has some more friends.

602
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
